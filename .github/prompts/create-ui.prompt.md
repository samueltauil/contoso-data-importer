description: Create a React.js application with Vite based on the provided mockup image.
---
Using the attached mockup image, implement this UI as a React.js application with Vite, creating all necessary files including components, styles, and configuration to match the design exactly. Avoid using any framework templates; all styling should be done with plain CSS or CSS-in-JS. Ensure the application is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Provide clear instructions on how to run the application locally.
