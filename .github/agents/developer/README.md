# Developer Personal Workspace

This folder contains the Developer agent's personal workspace for implementation patterns, technical decisions, and retrospectives.

## Purpose

- Store reusable code patterns and implementation approaches
- Document technical decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain debugging notes and problem-solving strategies
- Record retrospectives on successful implementations
- Track environment-specific tooling and configurations

## Structure

Organize files by date and topic:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md` for dated implementation notes
- `patterns/` for reusable code patterns
- `debugging/` for debugging approaches and solutions
- `retrospectives/` for lessons learned
- `environment/` for tooling and configuration notes

## Usage Guidelines

- Document complex implementation decisions
- Record successful patterns for reuse
- Track what approaches work well in different contexts
- Maintain notes on debugging strategies
- Update as new patterns and tools emerge
