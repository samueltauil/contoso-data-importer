# Data Architect Personal Workspace

This folder contains the Data Architect agent's personal workspace for data modeling patterns, architecture decisions, and retrospectives.

## Purpose

- Store reusable data modeling patterns and schema templates
- Document data architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Maintain performance optimization strategies and benchmarks
- Record retrospectives on successful data designs
- Track environment-specific database capabilities and configurations

## Structure

Organize files by date and topic:
- `YYYY-MM-DD-topic-name.md` for dated architecture notes
- `patterns/` for reusable data modeling patterns
- `schemas/` for reference schema designs
- `retrospectives/` for lessons learned
- `environment/` for database and platform capabilities

## Usage Guidelines

- Document complex data architecture decisions
- Record successful modeling patterns for different use cases
- Track performance benchmarks and optimization techniques
- Maintain notes on database-specific best practices
- Update as new patterns and technologies emerge
